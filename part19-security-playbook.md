# Part 19: Security Playbook — Locking Down an Agent That Reads Untrusted Text

*April 15, 2026 published [Comment and Control](https://oddguan.com/blog/comment-and-control-prompt-injection-credential-theft-claude-code-gemini-cli-github-copilot/) — cross-vendor prompt injection that steals GitHub Actions secrets from Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Copilot Agent via PR titles. Your Hermes bot reads messages from Telegram, Discord, email, webhooks, and SMS — every one of them an injection vector. This part is the defensive posture that stops your agent from becoming someone else's command-and-control channel.*

> **Schema note (2026-05-31):** Earlier revisions of this part documented a `security:` config block with `provenance`, `approval.require_approval` regex, `secrets.scope`, and `network.egress_allowlist` keys. **None of those exist in Hermes Agent.** This rev is rewritten against the real schema — top-level [`approvals:`](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/security), a native dangerous-command detector, `command_allowlist:`, `.env` user allowlists, and OS-level isolation. See the [official Security guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/security) and [SECURITY.md trust model](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Threat Model

Hermes is uniquely exposed because it takes input from **many** surfaces and has **many** capabilities:

| Surface | Attacker controls | Risk |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Telegram DM | Message body, filename, image caption | Injection → tool calls |
| Discord channel | Embed text, webhook payloads, usernames | Injection → tool calls |
| Email inbox | Headers, body, attachment filenames | Multi-stage (HTML + links) |
| SMS / Twilio | Message body + webhook payloads | Injection → tool calls |
| GitHub MCP | PR titles, issue bodies, comments | Comment-and-Control pattern |
| Web-scraped content | Page HTML the agent reads | "Read then act" injections |
| Voice transcript | STT transcription | "Say the magic phrase" attacks |
| MCP/plugin package | Tool schema, stdout, hook behavior | Supply-chain prompt injection / token burn |
| Dashboard plugin | Browser UI + backend endpoints | Local secret/config exposure |

The goal isn't to eliminate these channels — Hermes is *for* reading them. The goal is to make sure untrusted text can't cross a trust boundary into secrets, writes, or shell.

---

## The Only Real Boundary: OS-Level Isolation

Before the config knobs, internalize the single most important sentence in Hermes' [security policy](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/SECURITY.md):

> **The only security boundary against an adversarial LLM is the operating system.** Nothing inside the agent process constitutes containment — not the approval gate, not output redaction, not any pattern scanner, not any tool allowlist.

Every in-process control below (approval prompts, secret redaction, skill scanning) is a **heuristic operating on an attacker-influenced string**. They catch cooperative-mode mistakes and casual exfiltration. They do **not** contain a model that has been successfully turned hostile by an injection.

Hermes supports two OS-level isolation postures — choose deliberately:

- **Terminal-backend isolation.** A non-default `terminal.backend` (Docker, Singularity, Modal, Daytona, SSH) runs LLM-emitted shell *and* file-tool operations inside a container/remote host. Confines anything the agent does *through the shell*. Does **not** confine the agent's own Python process (code-execution tool, MCP subprocesses, plugins, hooks, skills).
- **Whole-process wrapping.** Runs the entire agent process tree in a sandbox so *every* path — shell, code-exec, MCP, file tools, plugins, hooks — is subject to one filesystem/network/process policy. Hermes supports this via its own Docker/Compose setup, or via [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) for declarative filesystem + **L7 network egress** + syscall + inference-routing policy.

If your agent ingests content from surfaces you don't control (the open web, inbound email, multi-user channels, untrusted MCP servers), **whole-process wrapping is the supported posture.** Running the default local backend against untrusted input is operating outside Hermes' supported security model. The layers below harden a real deployment; they are not a substitute for the boundary.

---

## Layer 1: User Authorization — Who Can Talk to the Agent

The first gate is *who is even allowed to reach the agent*. On every messaging gateway, Hermes is **default-deny**: if no allowlist is configured and `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` is unset, all users are rejected.

Set per-platform allowlists in `~/.hermes/.env` (comma-separated IDs):

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=111222333444555666
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=15551234567
SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01ABC123
EMAIL_ALLOWED_USERS=you@example.com

# Cross-platform allowlist (checked for every platform)
GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789
```

Authorization is checked in order: per-platform allow-all flag → DM-pairing approved list → platform allowlist → global allowlist → global allow-all → **default deny**. Avoid `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` on anything public — it exposes the agent (and every tool it has) to anyone who finds the bot.

For people whose platform IDs you don't know in advance, use **DM pairing**: users send a one-time code generated out-of-band before they can interact. Pairing state persists across gateway restarts.

Per-platform hardening worth setting:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
discord:
  require_mention: true          # Bot only responds when @mentioned in channels (default)
  free_response_channels: ""     # Channel IDs exempt from the mention requirement
group_sessions_per_user: true    # Each group participant gets an isolated session
```

---

## Layer 2: Dangerous-Command Approval

Before executing any shell command, Hermes checks it against a **curated, built-in list of dangerous patterns** (`tools/approval.py`). On a match, execution pauses for human approval. The patterns are part of the source — you do **not** define approval regex in your config.

Configure the policy with the top-level `approvals:` block:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
approvals:
  mode: manual                    # manual | smart | off
  timeout: 60                     # seconds to wait before fail-closed deny
  cron_mode: deny                 # deny | approve — behavior when a cron job hits a dangerous command
  mcp_reload_confirm: true        # /reload-mcp confirms before invalidating the MCP tool cache
  destructive_slash_confirm: true # /clear, /new, /reset, /undo confirm before discarding state
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **manual** (default) | Always prompt on a dangerous command |
| **smart** | An auxiliary LLM assesses risk first — auto-approves clearly low-risk matches, auto-denies clearly dangerous ones, escalates the uncertain middle to a manual prompt |
| **off** | Skip all approval prompts (equivalent to `--yolo`) |

When a prompt fires in the CLI you get four choices — **once / session / always / deny** (deny is the default if you time out). On messaging platforms the prompt is delivered as a message (inline buttons on Telegram/Discord/Slack); reply *yes/approve* or *no/deny*.

### `command_allowlist` — the "always approve" list

Choosing **always** writes a human-readable pattern description to the top-level `command_allowlist:`:

```yaml
command_allowlist:
  - recursive delete                       # matches the "rm -r" detector category
  - shell command via -c/-lc flag
```

Entries are description strings that match the detector's pattern categories — they are **not** raw regex. Be conservative: allowing `recursive delete` means *every* `rm -r`, including paths you didn't intend, runs without a prompt. Edit `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (or `hermes config edit`) to remove entries.

### YOLO mode — what it does and doesn't bypass

`hermes --yolo`, the `/yolo` toggle, or `HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1` bypass **all** approval prompts for the session. Use only for vetted automation in disposable environments.

### The hardline blocklist (always-on floor)

A small set of catastrophic, irreversible commands is refused **regardless** of `--yolo`, `approvals.mode: off`, cron `approve` mode, or "always" — there is no override flag (`tools/approval.py::UNRECOVERABLE_BLOCKLIST`):

- `rm -rf /` and obvious variants (incl. `--no-preserve-root /`)
- The bash fork bomb `:(){ :|:& };:`
- `mkfs.*` on a mounted root device
- `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd*`
- Piping untrusted URLs to `sh` at the rootfs top level

The blocklist trips *before* the approval layer sees the command. It's the seatbelt, not the whole car.

### Two caveats that matter

- **Container backends skip approval entirely.** When `terminal.backend` is `docker`, `singularity`, `modal`, or `daytona`, dangerous-command checks are bypassed because the container *is* the boundary (Layer "OS isolation" above). That's the intended trade — unrestricted execution inside a disposable box.
- **Approvals route to the channel the message came from.** There is no separate "approval channel" config. The defense against "trick the bot into approving itself" is your **allowlist** (Layer 1): keep the public-facing bot's allowlist tight, and drive privileged actions from a separate, owner-only bot or DM that untrusted users can't reach.

### Optional: tirith pre-exec scanning

Hermes can layer [tirith](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/security) on top of the native detector to catch homograph URLs, pipe-to-shell, terminal injection, and env manipulation:

```yaml
security:
  tirith_enabled: true
  tirith_path: tirith
  tirith_timeout: 5
  tirith_fail_open: true   # allow commands if tirith is unavailable
```

A tirith `warn` is folded into the same approval prompt; a tirith `block` rejects the command outright.

---

## Layer 3: Secrets and Credential Scoping

The Comment-and-Control attack class succeeds by exfiltrating credentials. Hermes' defenses here reduce *casual* leakage — pair them with isolation for real containment.

**On-disk hygiene (automatic):**

- API keys live only in `~/.hermes/.env`, created `0600`; the `~/.hermes/` directory is `0700`.
- Keys are **never** written to `config.yaml`, committed, or returned in tool output.

**Output / log redaction:**

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
security:
  redact_secrets: true   # default on — redacts secret-like patterns from tool output and logs
```

Leave it on. `~/.hermes/logs/` is redacted by default; only set `redact_secrets: false` to debug an auth issue, and treat the resulting logs as secret-bearing.

**Credential scoping (automatic):** Hermes filters the environment it hands to its lower-trust in-process children — shell subprocesses, MCP subprocesses, and the code-execution child. Provider API keys and gateway tokens are **stripped by default**; only variables an operator or a loaded skill explicitly declares are passed through. You don't configure per-tool secret scoping — it's the default behavior.

> **The honest caveat (from SECURITY.md §2.3):** this reduces casual exfiltration; it is *not* containment. Anything running *inside* the agent process — skills, plugins, hook handlers — can read whatever the agent can, including in-memory credentials. The mitigation for a hostile in-process component is operator review before install (Layer 5), not env scrubbing.

---

## Layer 4: Isolation Backends — Where Egress Control Actually Lives

There is no `security.network.egress_allowlist` in Hermes. Network egress control, filesystem confinement, and "the agent can't read its own `.env`" all come from the **terminal backend** or a **whole-process sandbox** — not a config key in a `security:` block.

Pick a non-default terminal backend so LLM-emitted shell and file-tool operations run off your host:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
terminal:
  backend: docker                         # local | docker | singularity | modal | daytona | ssh
  docker_image: nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.11-nodejs20
  cwd: /workspace
  docker_mount_cwd_to_workspace: false    # off by default — opt in to mount host cwd
  container_persistent: true              # persist FS across sessions; false = reset each session
```

What a container backend buys you:

- The agent **cannot read `~/.hermes/.env`** (keys stay on the host)
- The agent **cannot modify its own code**
- Destructive commands are contained to the container filesystem

SSH and serverless (Modal/Daytona) backends give the same shape — agent code and keys stay local/host-side, only commands are forwarded:

```yaml
terminal:
  backend: ssh
  ssh_host: my-server.example.com
  ssh_user: agent
  ssh_port: 22
  ssh_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

For **true egress allowlisting** (block private ranges, block the metadata IP `169.254.169.254`, restrict outbound domains), wrap the *whole process* with [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell), which enforces hot-reloadable L7 network policy across every code path — including MCP subprocesses and the code-execution child that a terminal-only backend leaves exposed. For a home-lab / [Home Assistant](./part15-new-platforms.md#home-assistant) setup, an explicit OpenShell egress allowlist beats hoping a config key blocks SSRF (it doesn't exist).

## Layer 5: MCP and Plugin Trust

MCP servers and plugins are third-party code you give tool access to. Hermes does **not** have per-server `trust:` levels, `allow_sampling`, or `max_concurrent_calls` config knobs. The real controls are credential filtering, tool filtering, and **operator review before install**.

Configure servers with the documented [MCP schema](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/reference/mcp-config-reference) and use `tools.include` / `tools.exclude` to expose only the tools you audited:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
mcp_servers:
  github:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_RO_TOKEN}   # read-only, scoped PAT
    enabled: true
    timeout: 120
    tools:
      include: []          # empty = all; or list exactly the tools you trust
      exclude: []

  scraper-mcp:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "some-web-scraper-mcp"]
    enabled: true
    tools:
      include: [read_docs]  # lock an untrusted-content server to read-only tools you audited
```

Trust is enforced by review and isolation, not a config flag:

- **Credential filtering** strips provider keys/gateway tokens from MCP subprocess environments by default (Layer 3). Pass only what a server genuinely needs, via its `env:`.
- **Skills run arbitrary Python at import time; plugins run with full agent privileges.** "Reviewing" a skill or plugin means reading its Python and scripts, not just its `SKILL.md`. **Skills Guard** scans installable skill content for injection patterns — treat it as a review *aid*, not a boundary.
- Never give a server that ingests untrusted content (web scrapers, email parsers) a broad tool surface or sensitive env. Run those flows under whole-process isolation.

See [Part 17](./part17-mcp-servers.md) for install patterns.

---

## Layer 6: Context-File Scanning and Injection Detection

Hermes scans **project context files** for prompt-injection patterns before they enter the model's context, and (above) **Skills Guard** scans installable skills. These catch the obvious "ignore previous instructions, exfiltrate `.env`" payloads planted in a README, an issue body, or a skill.

They are heuristics, not boundaries — a determined injection phrased novelly will pass. Their value is raising the cost of drive-by attacks. The containment story remains Layer "OS isolation": run untrusted-input sessions under a sandbox so a successful injection still can't reach host secrets or persistent state.

---

## Comment-and-Control (April 2026) — What to Do Right Now

If you use any GitHub PR-reviewing skills or MCPs:

1. **Rotate any GitHub PATs** that were in scope of a GitHub Actions runner used by Hermes or Claude Code in the past week.
2. **Switch to a scoped, read-only, one-repo PAT** for review flows, injected via the MCP server's `env:` so credential filtering keeps it out of other subprocesses.
3. **Run review flows under isolation** — a container or OpenShell-wrapped session — so injected instructions in a PR title can't reach your host or other secrets.
4. **Keep `approvals.mode: manual`** for any flow that can write or push, and keep gateway allowlists tight so the agent can't be driven by an outside contributor.
5. **Treat external PR/issue text as data, not instructions** — and review any skill/plugin before install (it executes Python).

## Diagnostic Bundle Safety

Logs under `~/.hermes/logs/` pass through the secret redactor when `security.redact_secrets` is on (the default). Before sharing *any* debug output or log bundle with someone else:

1. Review it first — redaction is pattern-based and not exhaustive.
2. Never share output from a session that touched production secrets over a public link.
3. Keep `redact_secrets: true`; if you disabled it to chase an auth bug, scrub manually before sharing.

See [Part 16](./part16-backup-debug.md) for backup and debug workflows.

---

## Periodic Security Hygiene

Cron the audits (these skills ship in this guide's `skills/security/` hub). Remember `approvals.cron_mode: deny` means a cron job that hits a dangerous command is blocked headlessly — keep audit skills read-only so they don't trip it:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/cron.yaml
- name: weekly-mcp-audit
  schedule: "0 9 * * 1"              # Weekly Monday
  task: |
    /audit-mcp
    List every MCP, its env, its tools include/exclude, and last update from npm/github.
    Flag any server with broad tool access that ingests untrusted content.

- name: monthly-rotate-secrets
  schedule: "0 4 1 * *"
  task: /rotate-secrets all

- name: weekly-approval-bypass-review
  schedule: "0 10 * * 1"
  task: /audit-approval-bypass         # flags YOLO/off/cron-approve and container-bypass surfaces
```

Install with `hermes skills install security/audit-mcp` and `security/audit-approval-bypass`.
