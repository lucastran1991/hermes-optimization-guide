# Part 20: Observability & Cost Control — Langfuse, Helicone, Kanban, /usage, Routing Playbooks

*You can't optimize what you can't see. Hermes tracks tokens, latency, and errors natively, but once you're running across CLI + Telegram + Discord + Google Chat + LINE + SimpleX + Teams + cron + Kanban worker lanes, you want a real tracing stack. This part sets up Langfuse, Helicone, or OpenTelemetry → Phoenix with one config block, then gives you the cost-routing playbook that dropped our test deployment from $34 to $3 per feature implementation.*

## The Three-Level Stack

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 3 — Hosted tracing (Langfuse / Helicone / Phoenix)│
│  Replayable traces, prompt versioning, evals            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↑
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 2 — Hermes internals (/usage, /status, dashboard)│
│  Token counts, rate-limit headers, per-session cost     │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↑
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 1 — Logs (~/.hermes/logs/*, `hermes logs tail`)  │
│  Raw events, tool invocations, errors                   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You always have Level 1 and 2. Level 3 is the force multiplier once you're spending more than $50/mo on LLM calls.

## Level 1 + 2 — What Ships With Hermes

### `/usage`

```
/usage                              # Current session
/usage 7d                           # Rolling 7-day window
/usage --by-provider                # Breakdown
/usage --by-skill                   # Which skills burn tokens
/usage --by-gateway                 # CLI vs Telegram vs Discord
```

As of v0.9.0 this now includes **rate-limit headers** captured from each provider — you can see "how close am I to the 5M/min ceiling" without digging into logs.

### Dashboard Analytics

The [Web Dashboard](./part12-web-dashboard.md) has an Analytics tab with:

- Cost by day / week / month
- Tokens in vs out (streaming-aware)
- Per-skill utilization (which ones actually earn their token cost)
- Tool call distribution (are you really using all those MCPs?)
- Error rates per provider (for failover tuning)

### `hermes logs`

```bash
hermes logs tail -f                 # Live tail, all gateways
hermes logs search "TokenLimit"     # Grep
hermes logs export --since 7d       # JSONL for offline analysis
```

Combine with `jq` or load into DuckDB for ad-hoc cost analysis:

```bash
hermes logs export --since 30d --format jsonl \
  | duckdb -c "SELECT gateway, SUM(tokens_out) FROM read_json_auto('/dev/stdin') GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC"
```

---

## Level 3 — Langfuse (Recommended Default)

Langfuse is the "everything in one place" option: tracing, prompt management, evals, self-hostable. If you're not sure where to start, start here. Since v0.12, Langfuse also ships as a bundled observability plugin, so prefer enabling that over hand-rolled hooks.

```bash
hermes plugins enable observability/langfuse
```

### Setup (Hosted Cloud)

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
observability:
  langfuse:
    enabled: true
    host: https://cloud.langfuse.com
    public_key: ${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}
    secret_key: ${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}
    sample_rate: 1.0                # Reduce for very high volume
    traced_tools:                    # Which tool calls to capture
      - terminal
      - github
      - claude-code
      - gemini-cli
    redact_payloads: true            # Redacts before sending (matches your security.secrets.patterns)
```

Get the keys from https://cloud.langfuse.com → Settings → API Keys. Free tier covers most individual users.

### Self-Hosted Langfuse

For privacy or compliance, one-liner on a VPS with Docker:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://langfuse.com/docker-compose.yml -o langfuse.yml
docker compose -f langfuse.yml up -d
```

Point `host:` at your domain. Hermes sends OTLP over HTTPS, so Caddy with Let's Encrypt just works.

### What You See

Each Hermes turn becomes a trace. Each trace has spans for:

- `agent.turn` (root)
  - `llm.call` (with prompt, completion, tokens, cost, latency)
  - `tool.call` (each tool with args, result, duration)
    - nested `llm.call` for sampling-enabled MCP servers
  - `memory.search` (queries and hits)
  - `skill.load` (which skills got pulled in)
  - `kanban.task` / `kanban.worker` when a durable board lane claims or completes work

Replay any turn, inspect the exact prompt, compare with previous runs, eval completions against datasets. This is how you find the turn that spent $4 on "how should I name this variable".

---

## Level 3 — Helicone (Gateway-First, Zero Code)

Helicone is the "swap the base URL and ship" option. You don't add a tracing SDK — you route your LLM traffic through a proxy that observes it.

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://anthropic.helicone.ai
    headers:
      Helicone-Auth: Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}
      Helicone-Property-Session: ${HERMES_SESSION_ID}
      Helicone-Property-Skill: ${HERMES_ACTIVE_SKILL}

  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://oai.helicone.ai/v1
    headers:
      Helicone-Auth: Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}
      Helicone-Cache-Enabled: "true"   # Automatic prompt caching
```

Hermes passes session ID and skill name as Helicone custom properties, so you can filter traces by skill/session in the Helicone UI. Cache hits (identical prompts) are free — this alone cuts bills noticeably for repetitive skills.

Pick Helicone over Langfuse when:

- You want zero code-level integration
- You want provider-level prompt caching for free
- You mostly care about cost + latency dashboards, not prompt management

---

## Level 3 — OpenTelemetry → Phoenix (Standards-First)

If you already run OpenTelemetry (Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb), wire Hermes into your existing pipeline:

```yaml
observability:
  otel:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: https://otel.yourdomain.com:4318
    protocol: http/protobuf
    headers:
      authorization: Bearer ${OTEL_TOKEN}
    attributes:
      service.name: hermes-prod
      deployment.environment: production
```

Hermes emits `gen_ai.*` spans following the [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) conventions. Point them at [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com) (self-hosted or cloud) for an LLM-specific view; or at your existing Grafana/Tempo for a "one pane of glass" view.

## Cost Routing Playbook (The One That Actually Saves Money)

### Rule 1: Route by Task Complexity, Not Default

Most Hermes cost bloat comes from using your most expensive frontier model for tasks Gemini Flash, Kimi/Moonshot, GLM, MiniMax, Cerebras, or a local model would handle identically. Set up a **task-aware default**:

```yaml
model_routing:
  default:
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    provider: anthropic
  routes:
    - match: { intent: [classification, extraction, triage, sum_under_500_tokens] }
      model: gemini-3.1-flash
      provider: google
    - match: { intent: long_context, tokens_gte: 150000 }
      model: gemini-3.1-pro
      provider: openrouter
    - match: { intent: [write_code, refactor, debug], complexity: medium }
      model: glm
      provider: zai
    - match: { intent: [write_code, refactor, debug], complexity: high }
      model: claude-sonnet-5
      provider: anthropic
    - match: { intent: [reasoning, math], complexity: high }
      model: reasoning
      provider: openai
```

Hermes classifies intent via a tiny prompt (~100 tokens) and routes accordingly. Empirically:

| Scenario | Naive frontier default | Routed | Savings |
|----------|----------------------------|--------|---------|
| Feature implementation (100 calls) | ~$34 | ~$3 (mostly Kimi/GLM) | 91% |
| Long-doc summarization (10 calls, 200K each) | ~$42 | ~$4 (Gemini Pro) | 90% |
| Daily classification triage | ~$18/day | ~$1/day (Flash) | 94% |

### Rule 2: Prompt Caching Is Free Money

Every stable chunk (system prompt, skill, SOUL.md, memory digest) should be cached:

```yaml
prompt_caching:
  enabled: true
  providers: [anthropic, openai, helicone]
  cache_system_prompt: true          # Biggest win
  cache_skills: true
  cache_memory_digest: true
  min_cache_tokens: 1024             # Anthropic's minimum
```

v0.14 extends Claude prompt-prefix caching across sessions for up to 1 hour, so repeated skills/SOUL/memory prefixes get faster and cheaper after `/new` too. Anthropic's prompt caching discount is ~90% on cached reads. For a 5K-token system prompt used 100 times a day, that's a real $2–5 a day saved.

### Rule 2B: Track Browser/CDP Latency Separately

v0.14's persistent CDP path makes browser-console and dashboard automation much faster, but only if you can see when it falls back to cold browser startup. Add a browser lane to traces when you rely on computer/browser tools:

```yaml
telemetry:
  spans:
    browser_cdp: true
    computer_use: true
```

Alert on repeated cold CDP starts; it usually means Chrome died, the profile changed, or a sandbox reset removed the persisted connection.

### Rule 3: Use Fast Mode Surgically

[Fast Mode](./part14-fast-mode-watchers.md) (`/fast`) costs more per token but reduces queue latency. Use it for:

- Interactive CLI sessions where you're watching the output
- Telegram conversations where the user is waiting
- Real-time voice flows

Don't use it for:

- Cron / scheduled tasks
- Nightly analysis jobs
- Long bulk operations

```yaml
fast_mode:
  defaults:
    cli: on
    telegram: on
    discord: on
    cron: off
    webhooks: off
  user_override: true                # User can toggle with /fast
```

### Rule 4: Context Is the Real Cost — Use `/compress`

Most sessions' 100th turn costs 10x the 10th turn. [`/compress <topic>`](./part14-fast-mode-watchers.md#compress-topic--guided-compression) plus the pluggable context engine can cap per-turn cost:

```yaml
compression:
  auto:
    enabled: true
    at_tokens: 48000                 # Compress when session exceeds this
    preserve:
      - last_n_turns: 10
      - tool_results_matching: "error|ERROR|failed"
    topics_from: active_skill         # Use active skill name as compression topic
```

### Rule 5: Alert on Cost Anomalies

```yaml
alerts:
  cost_spike:
    window: 1h
    threshold_usd: 5                 # Alert if > $5 in an hour
    channel: telegram_private
  token_anomaly:
    window: 10m
    threshold_tokens_per_turn: 30000
    channel: telegram_private
```

Catches runaway loops (a skill stuck in a retry tornado) and prompt injection attempts (attacker trying to burn your tokens).

## Eval-Driven Regression Prevention

Once you have Langfuse, add a dataset + evals for your critical paths:

```bash
# One-time setup
hermes evals init
hermes evals dataset create telegram-support-flows
hermes evals dataset add telegram-support-flows ~/.hermes/traces/support/*.json

# Run on every release
hermes evals run telegram-support-flows --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
hermes evals run telegram-support-flows --model zai/glm     # Check if cheaper model still passes
hermes evals compare
```

This is how you confidently swap a $10/Mtok model for a $0.30/Mtok one — empirically, not by vibes.
