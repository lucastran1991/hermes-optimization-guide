# Part 14: Fast Mode & Background Watchers

*Priority-tier inference, live background-process events, and the newer TUI controls that keep long sessions steerable instead of stuck.*

---

## Fast Mode (`/fast`)

### What It Is

Both OpenAI and Anthropic run **priority processing queues** for latency-sensitive traffic. Higher cost per token, but dramatically lower p50 and p99 latency — especially under load on reasoning models.

`/fast` toggles that priority tier per session. On supported OpenAI/Codex and Anthropic models, flipping it on injects `service_tier: "priority"` into outgoing requests.

### When to Use It

- **Interactive CLI sessions** where you're waiting on each response (coding, debugging).
- **Messaging replies** where a slow answer is a bad UX (Telegram, iMessage, WeChat).
- **Subagent-heavy workflows** where the orchestrator latency stacks (Part 8).
- **Whenever the default tier is rate-limited** — priority tier has its own pool.

Don't use it for:
- Batch cron jobs or overnight research runs where latency doesn't matter.
- Anything where you're trying to minimize cost and the default tier is fine.

### How to Toggle

In any interactive session (CLI or messaging platform):

```text
You → /fast
  Fast mode: ON (service_tier=priority)
```

It persists until you toggle it off:

```text
You → /fast
  Fast mode: OFF (service_tier=default)
```

### Or Set It Globally

In `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
agent:
  service_tier: priority   # default, priority, or flex
```

This makes Fast Mode the default for every new session. The `/fast` slash command still overrides per-session.

### Where It Works

- ✅ Interactive CLI (`hermes`)
- ✅ Every gateway platform as of v0.9 — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage (BlueBubbles), WeChat, Matrix, Email, SMS, DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, Mattermost, Home Assistant, Webhooks
- ✅ Cron jobs (set `agent.service_tier: priority` in config)
- ✅ Subagents (`delegate_task` inherits the parent's tier)
- ❌ Local/Ollama models (no priority tier exists)
- ❌ Free OpenRouter variants (the `:free` suffix forces default tier)

### Pricing Heads-Up

Priority tier is more expensive per token. Watch the **Analytics** tab in the dashboard (Part 12) for per-day cost deltas after enabling it. If you're surprised by a bill, the most common cause is leaving `agent.service_tier: priority` on globally for cron jobs that don't need it.

## `/steer`, `/queue`, and Background Turns

The newer TUI makes long-running work much easier to control:

| Command | Use it when | Pattern |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/steer <instruction>` | The agent is mid-run but drifting | "Continue, but don't edit generated files" |
| `/queue <prompt>` | You want the next task to start after the current one | "After tests pass, summarize the risk" |
| `/background <prompt>` | Fire off work without blocking the main chat | "Research alternatives while I keep coding" |
| `/busy` | You want to inspect what Hermes is doing | Check active runs/subagents |
| `/indicator` | The spinner/activity feed is too loud or too quiet | Toggle busy indicator style |

Best practice:

1. Use `/steer` for **constraints**, not brand-new goals.
2. Use `/queue` for dependent follow-ups.
3. Use `/background` for independent research or monitoring.
4. If the run touches files, keep follow-up prompts specific enough that Hermes can avoid clobbering its own edits.

This is the practical replacement for repeatedly interrupting and restating the whole task.

## Background Process Monitoring (`watch_patterns`)

### The Problem This Fixes

A huge chunk of agent work is "run a long thing and wait for a signal" — start a dev server and wait for `listening on port`, start a build and wait for a failure, run a test suite and wait for the summary line.

Before v0.9, the agent had two options:

1. Run the process in the foreground, block the agent loop, lose the ability to do anything else.
2. Run it in the background, then **poll** log output every few seconds, which is wasteful and introduces lag.

`watch_patterns` makes option 2 work correctly. You pass a pattern (or several) when you start a background process, and the agent gets a real-time event the moment the output matches — no polling.

### Basic Usage

Inside an agent session:

```
Start the dev server in the background. Watch for "listening on port"
to know it's ready, and for "EADDRINUSE" or "error" so you can surface
failures immediately.
```

Hermes uses the `terminal_run` tool with `watch_patterns`:

```json
{
  "command": "npm run dev",
  "background": true,
  "watch_patterns": [
    { "pattern": "listening on port \\d+", "label": "ready" },
    { "pattern": "EADDRINUSE|\\berror\\b", "label": "failure", "severity": "error" }
  ]
}
```

Each matched line gets delivered to the agent as an **event**, not a polled log snapshot — it's injected into the next turn like a tool result.

### Pattern Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `pattern` | yes | Python `re` regex, matched against each line of stdout/stderr |
| `label` | no | Human-friendly tag so the agent knows *which* watcher fired |
| `severity` | no | `info` (default), `warning`, or `error` — affects how the agent reacts |
| `max_matches` | no | Stop watching after N matches. Default: unlimited |
| `stop_process_on_match` | no | Kill the process when the pattern matches |

### Useful Recipes

#### Wait for a dev server to be ready, then run E2E tests

```json
{
  "command": "pnpm run dev",
  "background": true,
  "watch_patterns": [
    { "pattern": "Local:\\s+http://", "label": "ready", "max_matches": 1 }
  ]
}
```

Once `ready` fires, the agent knows it can proceed with the tests.

#### Fail fast on compilation errors

```json
{
  "command": "cargo build --release",
  "background": true,
  "watch_patterns": [
    { "pattern": "error\\[E\\d+\\]", "label": "rustc_error", "severity": "error", "stop_process_on_match": true }
  ]
}
```

#### Tail a log file forever, alert on specific lines

```json
{
  "command": "tail -F /var/log/app.log",
  "background": true,
  "watch_patterns": [
    { "pattern": "\\b5\\d\\d\\b", "label": "5xx", "severity": "warning" },
    { "pattern": "OOMKilled",      "label": "oom", "severity": "error" }
  ]
}
```

Pair this with a messaging platform gateway (Part 4 / Part 15) and you have a cheap production alerting pipeline with zero infrastructure.

### Inspecting What's Running

List background processes with active watchers:

```bash
/background list
```

or via the CLI:

```bash
hermes background list
```

Each row shows the PID, command, uptime, watcher count, and recent match count. Click a row (in the dashboard) to tail live output.

### Killing a Background Process

```bash
/background kill <pid>
```

Or use the dashboard's Logs page to find the process and click the terminate icon.

## Pluggable Context Engine

Related-but-separate feature also shipped in v0.9.0: the context engine — the thing that decides what gets injected into each agent turn — is now a **pluggable slot** via `hermes plugins`.

You can swap in a custom context engine that:

- Filters memory differently (e.g. only inject memory entries tagged `@project:my-project`)
- Summarizes tool output before injection (cheap local model pre-pass)
- Injects domain-specific context (pulling from LightRAG, a private vector DB, your CRM, etc.)

### Minimum Custom Engine

`~/.hermes/plugins/my-context/plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-context
version: 1.0.0
provides:
  context_engine:
    entrypoint: my_context:build_context
```

`~/.hermes/plugins/my-context/my_context.py`:

```python
from hermes_agent.context import ContextBundle, DefaultContextEngine

default_engine = DefaultContextEngine()

def build_context(session, turn) -> ContextBundle:
    bundle = default_engine.build_context(session, turn)

    # Inject an extra block every turn
    bundle.extras.append({
        "role": "system",
        "content": "## Project context\n" + _load_project_context(session),
    })

    # Filter memory to the active project only
    active_project = session.metadata.get("project")
    if active_project:
        bundle.memory = [m for m in bundle.memory if m.tags.get("project") == active_project]

    return bundle

def _load_project_context(session):
    # Read a file, query an API, hit LightRAG — whatever you want.
    ...
```

Enable it:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
context_engine: my-context
```

New sessions use the custom engine. Existing sessions keep the default until restart.

## `/compress <topic>` — Guided Compression

The existing context compressor (Part 6) now accepts a focus topic:

```text
You → /compress project migration to Fly.io
  Compressing 47 messages with focus: "project migration to Fly.io"
  Kept 6 messages verbatim, summarized 41 into 2 bullet blocks.
```

Without a topic, it runs with its default heuristics. With one, the summarizer preserves detail relevant to that topic and aggressively compresses the rest. Useful when you're 3 hours into a session and want to keep all the migration detail but jettison the 200 tool calls you ran to generate fixtures.

---

## `/goal` — Persistent Target Locking

v0.13 added `/goal`, and v0.14 pairs it with live `/handoff` for model/profile transfers for the long-loop version of this problem: not "compress this context," but "keep working until this observable objective is done."

```text
/goal Migrate the gateway to Google Chat, run checks, and leave a PR link.
```

Use it when the agent should continue across tool calls and intermediate updates until the exit condition is satisfied. For multi-agent work, pair it with [Part 23's Kanban board](./part23-tenacity-stack.md); for one focused session, `/goal` is enough.
