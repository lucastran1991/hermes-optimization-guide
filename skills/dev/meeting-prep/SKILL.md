# meeting-prep — Pre-Meeting Brief

Produces a one-page markdown brief so you walk into meetings knowing what's going on.

## Output shape

```markdown
## Meeting: {title}
**When:** {datetime} · **Duration:** {duration} · **Where:** {location}
**Attendees:** {list with titles where known}

### Context
- Last topic we discussed: {summary}
- Open asks from them: {list}
- Open asks from me: {list}

### Likely agenda
1. {item}
2. {item}

### My position / notes
{bulleted; pulled from memory if relevant}

### Warnings
- {anything they sent recently that suggests a tough topic}

### Quick links
- [last email thread]({url})
- [shared doc]({url})
- [previous meeting notes]({memory-link})
```

## Procedure

1. **Resolve meeting** from `lookup:`:
   - "next" → next calendar event in personal calendar
   - a time → nearest event at that time
   - a person → next event where that person is an attendee
   - event id → that exact event

2. **Gather** (parallel):
   - Last 10 emails with each attendee (last 90 days)
   - Last Slack DMs / channel mentions with each attendee (last 30 days)
   - Relevant docs from memory (`/search` with meeting title + attendee names)
   - Previous meeting notes if exist in memory

3. **Summarize** each thread to 1–2 lines. Extract open asks (things needing response, either direction).

4. **Produce** the brief. Keep under 400 words. Bias for brevity — this is a read-in-60-seconds doc.

5. **Attach** the brief as a Telegram DM reply to the trigger event, or print to CLI if invoked there.

## Triggering 15 min before each meeting

```yaml
cron:
  - name: meeting-prep
    schedule: "*/5 * * * *"   # every 5 min, idempotent
    task: "/meeting-prep next"
    filter: "event_starts_within=15m AND event.metadata.prep=true"
    notify: telegram_dm
```

## Memory discipline

This skill holds the `memory` toolset, so apply Part 7's save rules
deliberately — a wrong or transient memory is injected into every future
session and compounds.

**Save to memory** (durable, still true in 6 months):
- Stable attendee facts: role/title, timezone, communication style, standing
  preferences ("prefers async updates").
- Recurring-relationship context that improves *every* future brief.

**Do NOT save to memory** — recall with `session_search` instead:
- This meeting's agenda, open asks, or action items (task state, changes weekly).
- Anything one-off or date-specific ("follow up next Tuesday").

Default is read-only (see `security.notes`). Writing memory is the narrow
exception for durable relationship facts, never per-meeting task state.

## Tips

- Route to Gemini Flash — you'll run this often and it's a long-context summarization task.
- If your calendar is Google → use the Google Workspace MCP; if Outlook → Microsoft Graph MCP.
- Tag your calendar events with `prep:true` (or similar) to opt in — don't default-on for privacy.
