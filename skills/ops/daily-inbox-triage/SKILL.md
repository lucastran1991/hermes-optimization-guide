# daily-inbox-triage — Morning Sweep

Produce a **one-screen triage report**: what's urgent, what's a decision, what's noise, with a draft reply per actionable item.

## Procedure

1. **Collect** unread items from each configured channel within `window:`. Cap at 200 items; if over, prioritize starred / mentions / VIP-list senders.

2. **Classify** every item into one of:
   - `urgent` — time-sensitive, needs action today
   - `decision` — needs a yes/no/pick from me
   - `info` — FYI; noting what they said is enough
   - `noise` — newsletters, generic updates, obvious marketing
   - `spam` — confident spam (see [spam-trap](../../security/spam-trap/SKILL.md))

3. **Summarize** per item: one line of "who / what / ask". Keep under 80 chars.

4. **Draft replies** for every `urgent` and `decision` item. Keep replies under 4 sentences. Never include URLs the sender supplied without sanitizing.

5. **Output** as a single markdown message:

   ```
   ## Inbox Triage — {date}, last {window}

   ### Urgent ({n})
   - [email] Alice @ Acme — blocker on staging auth → draft: "{reply}" [/approve 1]
   - [slack] #incidents — payment API 500s → draft: "{reply}" [/approve 2]

   ### Decisions ({n})
   - [telegram] @pm — approve Q3 roadmap doc? → draft: "{reply}" [/approve 3]

   ### FYI ({n})
   - {brief one-liners}

   ### Noise ({n})
   - {unsubscribable patterns suggested}
   ```

6. **Surface**:
   - Any item matching a **VIP sender pattern** (from config) gets escalated regardless of classifier.
   - Any item mentioning **"urgent", "asap", "incident", "outage", "production"** escalates to `urgent` even if classifier disagreed.

7. **Never**:
   - Send replies automatically. Approval is required for every outbound.
   - Follow links from untrusted senders.
   - Summarize attachments without explicit user consent (privacy + prompt-injection risk).

## Example config snippet

```yaml
skills:
  overrides:
    daily-inbox-triage:
      vip_senders: [ceo@, "board@", "@lawyer.example.com"]
      escalate_keywords: [urgent, asap, incident, outage, production]

cron:
  - name: morning-inbox
    schedule: "0 8 * * 1-5"
    task: "/inbox-triage 24h"
    notify: telegram_dm
```

## Tips

- Keep this skill **reading-only by default** — it reports, you approve, you reply.
- Pair with [telegram-triage](../telegram-triage/SKILL.md) for same-shape logic on Telegram-only flows.
- Route to cheap models (Flash / Cerebras). You'll run this daily; every penny counts.
