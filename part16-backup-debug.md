# Part 16: Backup, Import, and `/debug` — Your Recovery Kit

*First-class backup/import, debug bundles, update preflights, and the hardening details you need before you let Hermes run unattended.*

## `hermes backup` and `hermes import`

### Why This Is a Big Deal

Until v0.9, migrating a Hermes install between machines meant `rsync -a ~/.hermes user@new-host:`. Which mostly worked — except for:

- Absolute paths baked into config (Docker mounts, log paths, skill script paths)
- Machine-specific provider endpoints (local Ollama, LAN-only LightRAG)
- SQLite session DB file locks if the source machine was still running
- Secrets you didn't actually want to copy (old dev keys, disabled provider API keys)

`hermes backup` produces a portable archive that handles all of that. `hermes import` replays it on the new machine with interactive conflict resolution.

### Creating a Backup

```bash
hermes backup
```

Produces `~/.hermes/backups/hermes-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.tar.zst` containing:

| Path | Included | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `config.yaml` | yes | Machine-specific paths (Docker mounts, local provider URLs) are rewritten to portable placeholders |
| `.env` | yes (redacted by default) | Secret values are zeroed; key names kept. Pass `--include-secrets` to include values in plaintext (use with care) |
| `memories/` | yes | All memory files |
| `skills/` | yes | All skills including executable scripts and references |
| `sessions.db` | yes | SQLite DB is dumped via `VACUUM INTO` so it's consistent even with a running gateway |
| `plugins/` | yes | Both CLI and dashboard plugins |
| `logs/` | no by default | Use `--include-logs` if you need them for debugging |
| `auth.json` | no | Never backed up — re-authenticate on the new machine |

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--output <path>` | Write to a specific path instead of the default backups directory |
| `--include-secrets` | Include `.env` values in plaintext (default: redacted) |
| `--include-logs` | Include `logs/` in the archive |
| `--exclude <path>` | Exclude a specific subpath (repeatable) |
| `--no-sessions` | Skip `sessions.db` (useful for sharing skill/memory libraries) |

### Common Recipes

**Full portable backup for migrating to a new machine:**

```bash
hermes backup --include-secrets --output ~/hermes-$(hostname).tar.zst
```

Treat that archive like a password manager vault — it contains every key.

**Share skills + memory with a teammate (no secrets, no sessions):**

```bash
hermes backup --no-sessions --output ~/hermes-share.tar.zst
```

Safe to email. Contains your prompting knowledge and procedural skills, nothing private.

**Scheduled backups to a mounted drive:**

```bash
hermes cron create \
  --deliver local \
  --schedule "0 3 * * *" \
  "run: hermes backup --output /mnt/backups/hermes-\$(date +%F).tar.zst"
```

---

### Importing a Backup

On the target machine:

```bash
hermes import ~/hermes-2026-04-17-030000.tar.zst
```

The importer walks through each section interactively:

```text
config.yaml
  ✓ No existing config. Importing.

.env
  ⚠ 12 existing keys, 18 in backup.
    [m] Merge (keep existing for duplicates)
    [r] Replace (backup overrides everything)
    [s] Skip
    [d] Diff before deciding
  Choice [m]:

memories/
  ⚠ 47 existing files, 52 in backup, 14 differ.
    [m] Merge (newer file wins)
    [r] Replace
    [s] Skip
    [d] Diff each conflicting file
  Choice [m]:

skills/
  ✓ Non-conflicting, importing 23 skills.

sessions.db
  ⚠ Existing sessions.db has 1,247 sessions. Backup has 892.
    [m] Merge (session IDs already deduped — safe)
    [r] Replace
    [s] Skip
  Choice [m]:
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Print what would happen without touching disk |
| `--strategy <merge\|replace\|skip>` | Non-interactive default for all conflicts |
| `--only <path>` | Import only a subpath (e.g. `--only skills/`) |
| `--rewrite-paths` | Re-scan config for paths that don't exist on this machine and prompt to fix them |

### Cross-Platform Notes

- **Sessions DB** — merges are deduplicated by session UUID; no risk of collisions.
- **Skills with shell scripts** — Unix permissions (`+x`) are preserved inside the archive. On Windows, you'll need WSL to run script-based skills anyway.
- **Config path rewriting** — on import, Hermes detects stale paths (e.g. `/home/alice/...` on a machine where `alice` doesn't exist) and prompts you to fix them before writing.
- **LightRAG data** — lives outside `~/.hermes`, so it's not in the backup. Back up `~/.hermes/lightrag` separately with `tar` or re-ingest on the new machine.

## `/debug` and `hermes debug share`

### The New Diagnostic Flow

When something goes weird, the old flow was: grep through `~/.hermes/logs/`, paste 800 lines into a GitHub issue, hope you got the right ones. The modern flow is:

```text
You → /debug
  Collecting diagnostics…
  ✓ Agent version: v0.14.0 (v2026.5.16)
  ✓ Platform: Linux 6.8.0 / Python 3.12.3
  ✓ Gateway: running (3 adapters connected)
  ✓ Last 200 lines of agent.log
  ✓ Last 200 lines of errors.log
  ✓ Config snapshot (secrets redacted)
  ✓ Active session metadata (no message content)

  Bundle: ~/.hermes/debug/debug-2026-04-17-030000.tar.gz

  Upload with: hermes debug share ~/.hermes/debug/debug-2026-04-17-030000.tar.gz
```

Then:

```bash
hermes debug share ~/.hermes/debug/debug-2026-04-17-030000.tar.gz
```

That uploads the bundle to the Hermes public debug endpoint and returns a short URL you can paste into a bug report. The upload:

- Redacts all `.env` secrets before leaving your machine
- Strips message content by default — only metadata (session ID, model, message count, tool calls)
- Expires after 14 days
- Is only readable by Nous support staff with the link

### What Gets Included

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| `system.json` | OS, Python, Hermes version, installed extras |
| `config.yaml` | Your config, with `.env` values redacted |
| `logs/agent.log` | Last N lines (default 200, `--lines` to change) |
| `logs/errors.log` | Last N lines |
| `logs/gateway.log` | Last N lines |
| `gateway-state.json` | Connected platforms, PIDs, last event times |
| `session-metadata.json` | Session IDs, models, message counts (no content) |
| `pip-freeze.txt` | Exact dependency versions |

### Opt-In for More

```bash
/debug --full
```

Includes message content for the active session, recent session tool call arguments, and LLM request/response pairs (with auth headers stripped). Only use this when a bug genuinely requires reproducing your exact prompt chain — it's more revealing than the default bundle.

### Without the Share Step

`/debug` always creates the local bundle. `hermes debug share` is a separate step. If you don't want to upload, just attach the tarball directly to a GitHub issue yourself.

## Pluggable Context Engine + `/compress <topic>`

Covered in more depth in [Part 14](./part14-fast-mode-watchers.md). TL;DR:

### Custom context engine

Plug-and-play replacement for what gets injected into each agent turn:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
context_engine: my-custom-engine
```

Use it to filter memory by project, pre-summarize tool output, pull from LightRAG or a private vector DB, etc. See Part 14 for a minimal implementation.

### `/compress <topic>`

The context compressor (Part 6) now takes an optional focus topic:

```text
You → /compress migration to Fly.io
  Compressing 47 messages with focus: "migration to Fly.io".
  Kept 6 messages verbatim, summarized 41 into 2 bullet blocks.
```

Preserves detail relevant to the topic and aggressively compresses everything else. Perfect for salvaging a long debugging session after you've solved the problem and want to keep the decision trail but ditch 200 exploratory tool calls.

## Security Hardening Notes

A handful of hardening changes landed in the "everywhere" + "gateway" releases worth calling out explicitly:

### v0.13+ redaction + hardline blocklist

Hermes v0.13+ turns secret redaction on by default and keeps the hardline blocklist for commands that should not be recoverable through casual approval prompts. Keep your own denylist too, but do not rely on "the model will know this is dangerous" for commands that delete homes, scrape credentials, or hit metadata services.

Useful custom denylist additions:

```yaml
security:
  approval:
    denylist:
      - 'rm\s+-rf\s+(/|~|\$HOME)'
      - 'curl\s+.+\|\s*(sh|bash)'
      - '169\.254\.169\.254'
      - 'cat\s+~?/?\.?ssh/'
      - 'aws\s+s3\s+sync\s+.+\s+s3://'
      - 'ssh-keyscan'
```

### `hermes update --check` before upgrades

Before a major upgrade:

```bash
hermes update --check
hermes backup
```

The preflight catches obvious incompatibilities and the backup gives you a rollback point for `HERMES_HOME`.

### Webhook secrets validated on startup

Every webhook-based adapter (Telegram, BlueBubbles, WeCom, Feishu, WeChat, generic Webhook) now validates its signing secret at gateway startup. A missing/empty/weak secret produces a startup error instead of silently accepting forged requests.

Generate strong ones:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### SSRF protection on outbound media

WeChat, Telegram, and BlueBubbles download inbound media through a validator that blocks:
- Private/loopback IPs (`10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, etc.)
- Link-local addresses (`169.254.0.0/16`)
- Metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254` — AWS/GCP IMDS)
- `file://`, `data://`, and other non-HTTP schemes

Set `HERMES_ALLOW_PRIVATE_MEDIA_URLS=true` only on trusted networks where your agent legitimately needs to fetch from an internal host.

### Env values redacted in all logs

Every log line now runs through a redactor by default that replaces values of known secret env vars with `<redacted:VAR_NAME>` before printing. Prevents accidental secret leakage to log aggregators or shared debug bundles.

### `sudo` and `rm -rf` still require explicit approval

Nothing new, but worth restating: dangerous commands still trigger the approval UI (`ask` / `yolo` / `deny`) regardless of service tier, gateway platform, or cron runner. `/fast` does not bypass approvals.

### Approval bypass for trusted subagents

Subagents spawned by the orchestrator now inherit the parent session's approval posture by default. If the parent session is in `yolo` mode (every tool call auto-approved), so is the subagent. If the parent is in `ask` mode, subagents prompt the user on dangerous calls. Override per delegation:

```python
delegate_task(
    goal="Research X",
    approvals="ask",        # override inherited posture
    toolsets=["file"],
)
```
